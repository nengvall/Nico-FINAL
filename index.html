           <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
              <p>In our highly digitized world, mass customization and consumerism are imperative when it comes to design and writing. Mastering rhetoric, or the art of persuasion, is crucial as the preferences, opinions, and physcological tendencies of viewers can equate to viewer engagement. However, creative and exciting technological advancements, such as AI, have intensified the ethical debate over whether technology has oversaturated creative design.   The initial logo design project grasps these ideas perfectly as the goal was to create attractive logos using technology to present in a user experience study. I used AI for my three logos, and while they were attractive and sleek, the responses illuminated a bleak professionalism theme. When I revised the logos, I prioritized including  personal details that I enjoyed, rather than presenting a sophistication theme.

            <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
              <p> It has been proven through countless pieces of design that principles such as hierarchy, alignment, proximity, proportion, and color scheme have tremendous effects on viewers interpretation and levels of engagement. In my cartoon design, I was surprised to see that viewers took notice to little details such as my Pirates hat, colombia logo, and shading. Viewers also said they noticed the details more vividly in relation to the subway station in the background. Furthermore, in my example of good design, I explained how similar color schemes and strategic typeface envoke feelings of eeriness. By examining examples of peices that leverage design principles, learning about the creative possibilities of typeface has become infinitely more interesting to me.

             <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
              <p>We will be working with other people in every aspect of our professional lives, so engaging with others in a workshop environment is extremely beneficial for improving our design skills. I have loved gaining insight from other sets of eyes as workshopping has improved every project of mine in the class. I have become accustomed to revealing my work with a mindset of openmindedness and honesty. Seeing my classmates work in the group and class workshops has also allowed me to picture what tatics would work on my own work. Asking questions and answering my classmates inquires has sharpened my observation skills, and has encouraged me to want to present my own work to thw whole class going foward.    </p>

              <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
              <p>Once we gain feedback from a workshop environment, engaging in revision should be next. I've come to learn that the process of exploration within media forms such as InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator are vital for revising work. For my personal logo project, I utilized Canva and Adobe Express in order to navigate which platform had stronger AI exploration. In my cartoon project, the process of trial and error allowed me to find the best tool for making smoother edges and shading. Exploring the powers of InDesign allowed me to refine my 'good design' project to create a consistent typeface that matched the original font of the movie cover I analyzed. The media at our disposal is vast and liberating, meaning my technical design skills will hopefully magnify my creative senses.    </p>

              <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
              <p>I enjoy presenting my research and work in my classes as it sharpens my ability to speak and explain topics to people I don't know persoanlly. However, I struggle a bit with art, photography, and design presentations because it is more creative and personal work. But, presenting my designs and ideas to my small group has proven to revitalize my passion for creativity. My attitude of the impromptu presentations has shifted to more of a mini workshop environment mindset where I can feed off other people's ideas and suggestions without feeling pressure. I believe it's been extremely rewarding to engage in the Design Fuego and UX Study presentation's so early in the class because it's a skill that will only become more necessary in my career.    </p>

            <p><em>1. Consider the role of rhetoric, technology, and ethics in acts of making.</em></p>
               <p>The art of rhetoric was extremely relevant and important in the process of making my short form projects. My resume project, advertisement project, and client project all heavily employ persuasion tatics as a means to attract viewership and readership. Specifically, the calm white and beige color scheme of my resume naturally emphasizes the informational components such as my name, profile, and contact information. From there, the writing portion of a resume is strictly a pitch to whoever is looking at it. Furthermore, for my music festival advertisement and client project, I wanted to put a big spotlight on attractive details, such as the performing artists and the meet and greet with Blake Hinson. I found that it's crucial to find the sweet spot of highlighting certain details to invoke interest, without over exaggerating them.      </p>

             <p><em>2. Leverage Design Principles.</em></p>
               <p>My two page spread project exemplifies good design principles very well. Firstly, the title features three variations of the same font. More specifically, the distinction between the words 'Fast Food' and 'America' is very imperative. 'Fast Food' in the color red plays at the tested pyschological effect that fast food restaurants use to invoke hunger. Right off the bat, viewers associate fast food with the larger 'America', which is an important and often relatable issue in our country. It makes viewers immediately ponder what about fast food in America is the article speaking to. Furthermore, the left side of the two page spread features a playful take on arguably the most recognizable fast food item in the world: the Big Mac from McDonald's. Overall, the spread takes a very common issue and presents it in a calm and playful way that people who are interested in the topic can relate to.     </p>

              <p><em>3. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
               <p>The workshop sessions are becoming more natural and helpful as I've become more acute and opionated in the world of design. I believe it's very important for everyone to contribute their own opinion as we all have extremely different viewpoints and interests. Even though other people in the class may be designing completely different projects, I've come to learn that it never hurts to have an extra set of eyes take a glance at my work. In a specific case, one of my classmates designed a flyer for a competitive video game group based in Pittsburgh. While the flyer was very attractive and interesting to look at, the class as a whole did not have much input because the flyer was very coded for people interested in video games. In terms of my client project, this workshop example made me wonder how I could make my client's flyer more attractive people not neccessarily interested in sports media relations and sports media. I found that adding the meet and greet with Blake Hinson was a great first step as my supervisor and classmates found it inticing immediately. </p>

               <p><em>4. Practice revision within and across media forms.</em></p>
               <p>At this point, I have become accustomed to testing out which adobe platforms and non-adobe platforms are better for different tasks. In my client project, I knew I wanted to isolate Blake Hinson in color and have the background muted. However, I could not find a solution in InDesign for this, so I played around with Photoshop and found an easy solution. I initially mutedthe whole picture by lowering the saturation, then I was able to intensify Blake in color using the brush tool very easily. Finally, I transferred the finished the product to InDesign to finish off  the textual aspects. For my resume project, I used Adobe's large library of resumes as references for my own. This was extremely helpful for figuring out which written components are most important and which color schemes emphasize those components and my personality.    </p>

     <div class="col-sm-4">
               <p><em>5. Learn to present your work.</em></p>
               <p>I enjoy presenting my work very much in the small group setting because it allows me to practice explaining my design and writing intentions without overwhelming pressure. These excercises are often very constructive, yet supportive. Like I stated before, everyone has their own set of important design and writing principles, so being able to hear differing inputs has proved to be very beneficial. I look fowards to presenting my work to the whole class again, as it is a skill that I have to master going foward in my career. Finding the perfect sweet spot of conveying the right amount of information while including personal anecdotes is one of my goals in my career as a media relations specialist, and presenting my work in small group and large group settings will help ensure I achieve that goal.    </p>
